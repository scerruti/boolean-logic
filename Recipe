Step 1.

Create a method generateTable(TwoVariableFunction aTwoVariableFunction) in TruthTable that returns a truth table for two variables as a string:

   A   |   B   | Result
-------+-------+--------
  True |  True | True
  True | False | False
  ...
  
  Don't forget to add '\n' to each line.
  
Step 2.

Boolean syntax

  A is a variable
  A' means not A
  + OR
  . AND

Create classes for the following two variable expressions by extending TwoVariableFunctions:

  A + B
  (A + B)'
  A' . B'
  A . B    (Given as an example)
  (A . B)'
  A' + B'
  
 Create JUnit tests to generate the truth tables for all of these classes.
 
 Which functions generated the same tables and why?
 
 Step 3.
 
 Create a method in displayTable(Function aFunction) in TruthTable that outputs a truth table for N variables.
 
 Step 4.
 
 Implement and test some Properties of Boolean Algebra
 
 Commutative Law
	(a) A + B = B + A
	(b) A . B = B . A

 Associate Law
	(a) (A + B) + C = A + (B + C) 
	(b) (A . B) . C = A . (B . C)

 Distributive Law
	(a) A . (B + C) = A . B + A . C
	(b) A + (B . C) = (A + B) . (A + C)

 Annulment Law
	(a) A . False = False
	(b) A + True = True 

 Identity Law
	(a) A + False = A 
	(b) A . True = A

 Idempotent Law
	(a) A + A = A 
	(b) A . A = A

 Complement Law
	(a) A' + A = True 
	(b) A' . A = False

 Double Negative Law
    (a) (A')' = A

 De Morgan's Theorem
	(a) (A + B)' = A' . B'  
	(b) (A . B)' = A' + B'    
 
 Absorption Laws
	(a) A  (A + B) = A
	(b) A + (A  B) = A
 
 Simplification Laws
	(a) A  (A' + B) = A  B
	(b) A + (A'  B) = A + B
	(c) A  B' + A  C + B'  C = A  B + B'  C   

 Bonus: What is added in Java 8 that could improve the appearance of the sample code?
